- **A Note on Race**
    - It may seem as though race was missing from the list when speaking about biological diversity. However, it has been proven over and over again that our concept of race is a social construct, and is not based on biology. Humans are genetically far too similar to one another to be considered members of different "groups" or "races". Instead, the idea of race originates from the segregational practice of lumping people into broad groups usually based on stereotypical physical and cultural traits.

## The Similarities and Differences of Human Biology
- **Unifying Humanity Through Biological Similarities**
    - As social animals, we often like to feel as though we belong to some kind of group. Our biological similarities and genetic heritage gives us a sense of belonging to a group much larger than ourselves, and provides us with insight into our ancestral history. These similarities are the basis for relating with those whom you share commonality with. Furthermore, when we remember that humans are all incredibly biologically similar to one another, it reminds us that we are all equal and more alike than we are different.

- **The Differences That Build Our Identities**
    - When we think about ourselves and reflect on how we would define ourselves, we often like to pick out the traits that are interesting and make us unique. The differences in our biology that we recognize form the traits that we associate with ourselves. Diverse appearances and bodily builds makes the world interesting and gives us a stronger sense of personal identity than we would have if we were all the same.
