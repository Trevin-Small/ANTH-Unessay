- **A Note on Race**
    - It may seem as though race was missing from the list when speaking about biological diversity. However, it has been proven over and over again that our concept of race is a social construct, and is not based on biology. Humans are genetically far too similar to one another to be considered members of different "groups" or "races". Instead, the idea of race originates from the segragatory practice of lumping people into broad groups usually based on stereotypical physical and cultural traits.
