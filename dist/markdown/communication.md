## The Essence of Communication
Communication is the means through which different individuals can share ideas an spread thoughts and information with one another.
It is vital to the development of not only humans, but many other animals as well.

Chimpanzees are an excellent example of another species which has effective communication capabilities.

- "Animal behaviorists Robert Seyfarth, Dorothy Cheney, and Peter Marler, then at Rockefeller University, placed a speaker out of sight and broadcast different alarm calls to a troop of vervet monkeys. The monkeys had predator-specific reactions to the different calls, even though there were no real predators around. Clearly, they were reacting to the call itself." (Schwartz, 2017).

These monkeys have developed their own form of language, one which allows them to convey ideas as specific as the *type* of predator which is in the region and endangering their troop, which allows the monkeys to respond appropriately and remain safe from the source of danger. Like monkes, humans have advanced forms of communication which allows us  to share our ideas with high levels of precision and expression, even more so than Chimpanzees.

Furthermore, broadening what is typically considered communication allows us to more fully understand and appreciate the complexity
of human communication. Verbal, Non-Verbal, and Artistic forms of communication are just a few examples of ways that humans share ideas with one another on a regular basis.
