## Unique Biological Potential

Humans possess many biological traits which are rare in nature, or in some cases, unique to the species. It is important to address these traits when talking about what it is that makes us human, since these traits dictate our abilities and define our strengths and weaknesses as a species.

## Distinctive Traits
- **Bipedality**
    - "*Bipedality, the ability to walk upright on two legs, is a hallmark of human evolution*." (Garlinghouse, 2019).
    While other species use bipedality, only humans use it as their main form of motion. This trait, according to Garlinghouse, may have begun in early humans up to 6 million years ago, with *Australopithecus* being the first species to be predominantly bipedal.
    - **This makes us human** because it is one of our flagship physical traits; Right off the bat, we can visually recognize the bipedality of humans,
      and given the context of other animals, understand that it is not a trait that other animals use to a large extent.

- **High Intelligence**
    - Undoubtedly the most impactful biological ability of humans is our high intelligence. It has opened the door to language, culture, and technology
      which is widely unavailable to other organisms. Our ability to learn, reason, and problem-solve have developed our crafting abilities to extremely
      high levels, giving us incredibly powerful modern technology that synergizes with our natural abilities and makes up for our weaknesses.

    - **This makes us human** because when we think of ourselves, we often identify the traits we have that other animals don't. Cars, complex houses, electronics,
      computers, medicine, and other technologies are incredibly advanced and unique strictly to humans.

## Biological Diversity
- The biological traits of humans are incredibly diverse. On the surface, we all have visible characteristics which make us unique; Our hair color and style (curly, straight, etc.), our height, skin tone, eye color, facial hair or lack thereof, and many more. These traits are all the results of varying gene pools and the expression of said genes.

- To hone in on one example, Hannah Seo, citing anthropologist Tina Lasisi's work, said about hair, "just as melanated skin protects against UV rays, tightly curled hairs also protect humans from the sun. Tight curls create lofted, airy ventilation structures for the head, allowing it to breathe while providing extra protection from solar radiation." Hair diversity came from adaptive needs, like all of our traits, and contributes to the diversity and beauty of our population.

- This biological diversity contributes to our identities - and therefore our humanity. The traits we have represent our familial history and often tie into our cultural backgrounds. Being human means being unique, complex, and multi-faceted. We as individuals are all one-of-a-kind, and our biological diversity is just one of the many factors that influence our sense of self.
