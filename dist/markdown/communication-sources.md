- **Art Makes Us Human**
  - No other species on Earth demonstrates artistic abilities as complex as humans. While some other animals have simpler forms of artistic abilities, only humans display these abilities to such a high level. I believe that the arts make us human because they are not only tied to closely to communication, but also to culture. Art provides a way for humans to take their ideas and experiences and immortalize them in various forms which can be perpetuated across generations and cultures.

- **Context of This Website**
  - Expression enabled by technology is my preferred form of art. I love using technology to create things that are visually pleasing to watch, especially when they are tied to patterns and mathematics. I feel like it lets me express myself and communicate my ideas and interests to others in a unique manner that can be appreciated by others.

### How Communication Makes Us Human
- Without the ability to share our ideas on a high level with one another, society would look very different today. Culture would struggle to be passed on, as past humans would not be able to effectively pass on their wisdom, traditions, and life experiences. Furthermore, the collaboration and social nature of humans would likely be much weaker, as it is our communication skills that allows us to work together so effectively. It is clear to see that communication has had an immeasurable impact on how humanity functions today, and our ability to express ourselves is vital to what we know as society.
