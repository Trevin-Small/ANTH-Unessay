- **Art Makes Us Human**
  - No other species on Earth demonstrates artistic abilities as complex as humans. While some other animals have simpler forms of artistic abilities, only humans display these abilities to such a high level. I believe that the arts make us human because they are not only tied to closely to communication, but also to culture. Art provides a way for humans to take their ideas and experiences and immortalize them in various forms which can be perpetuated across generations and cultures.

### How Communication Makes Us Human
- Without the ability to share our ideas on a high level with one another, society would look very different today. Culture would struggle to be passed on, as past humans would not be able to effectively pass on their wisdom, traditions, and life experiences. Furthermore, the collaboration and social nature of humans would likely be much weaker, as it is our communication skills that allows us to work together so effectively. It is clear to see that communication has had an immeasurable impact on how humanity functions today, and our ability to express ourselves is vital to what we know as society.

## How Communication Highlights our Similarities and Differences
- **Similarities**
  - Communication allows us to share ideas with one another and form closer, more intimate relationships as we learn more about each other. Communication is the basis of strong relationships, which is one of the if not the most important aspect of many people's lives. Furthermore, communication forms which are not language based are often able to be interpreted by anyone. Pictures, paintings, and other visual forms of communication transcend language barriers allowing artists to connect with anyone and share their thoughts.
- **Differences**
  - Communication, especially spoken communication, does have its limitations. The diversity of humans led to the development of many different languages and forms of expressions. When people do not know each others forms of communication, they are inhibited by language barriers that prevent them from speaking to one another. Despite this, the diversity of spoken language is a good thing, as it carries with it the culture and complex history of people throughout time.
