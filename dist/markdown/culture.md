## Culture's Role in Defining Our Identity
**Culture**: "The shared set of (implicit and explicit) values, ideas, concepts, and rules of behaviour that allow a social group to function and perpetuate itself" (Hudelson, 2004).

Culture is arguably the most important factor in our identity - it shapes who we are, influences our decisions, defines our way of life, and molds
our way of thinking throughout the entirety of our life. Culture is often passed on through generations via the family, though culture includes the
skills and ideas that are picked up along the journey of ones life, and is an ever-changing element of our identity.

- On the subject of humans, August√≠n Fuentes said, "Thanks to recorded histories and stories, humans - unlike any of our other relatives - can communicate our thoughts, ideas, experiences, wishes, and visions to other humans even after we are dead." While this point ties in strongly with communication, it demonstrates how human culture is so heavily dependent upon the the spread of masses of information throughout generations.

- Furthermore, culture is largely a result of the technological advances of humans restructuring our way of life. Fuentes said, "structural innovations and new social phenomena housed and birthed emerging social orders.... Each advance reconfigured the possibilities and patterns of distinctively human behavior." Without the technology that we currently have, the way that we communicate, the jobs we have, the industries that we work in, and the knowledge we possess would all be different. It is interesting to analyze how closely tied culture and technology are to one another, and it is especially visible throughout human history.

### How does it make us human?
- No other species is able to think and process the world quite like we are. Even ancient humans pondered the natural world, as explained in *Chimps Can't Tell Us Much About Being Human*, "they (humans, roughly 300,000 to 40,000 years ago) began to create explanations for observable phenomena, such as storms, the movement of the moon, and even death."
- Culture gives us a meaning to life and a new level of depth that other organisms simply don't experience. Humans display an unprecented level of understanding of the world around them, and we have countless practices and traditions that aren't essential to survival, but exist to give us purpose and make life enjoyable, including; Religion, Hobbies, Entertainment and Media, and far more. These practices are uniquely human and are big factors in our identities as people.

## The Wide Spectrum of Culture
The culture of a given individual represents the conglomeration of all of their life experiences. Given that we all live different lives, it is natural that culture is a source of similatires and differences between people; It makes us *unique*.

- **Culture Uniting Us Through Interpersonal Similarities**
  - Culture, when shared, is usually highly valued. People enjoy being around others who understand their background and have faced similar life experiences as them. It brings people together when they have the same traditions, languages, practices, and knowledge, and a sense of belonging is felt when being with a group of the same culture.

- **Culture Displaying Differences and Diversity**
  - Because of the long, complex history of humans, and especially the geographically diverse locations of people, the cultures of different groups was given ample time to develop uniquely. This has led to a beautful spectrum of diverse culture that makes everyone unique and provides a sense of "humanity". In recent times, there has been a push to appreciate diversity and learn of cultures different than the one familiar to you, which has helped us recognize the differences between people and value the individuality each member of humanity possesses.
