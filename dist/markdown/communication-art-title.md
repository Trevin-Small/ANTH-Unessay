## Communication Through Art
Art is, in my opinion, one of the most human traits we express. The creation of unique, symbolic works that are appealing in some sense (auditory, visual, etc.) and convey complex ideas and emotions is nothing short of incredible. Music, painting, sculptures, textiles, architecture, and countless other forms of art are found all throughout history and give us insight into the lives of humans who lived long before us. Looking at the present we still see the large impact artistic works have on society - music is a huge, multi-billion dollar industry and is listened to everyday by the majority of Americans. The arts give us a way to express ourselves on a deeper level than traditional communication allows, and provides a more intimate look into the thoughts of an artist.
