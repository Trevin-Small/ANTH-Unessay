- **Context of This Website**
  - Expression enabled by technology is my preferred form of art. I love using technology to create things that are visually pleasing to watch, especially when they are tied to patterns and mathematics. I feel like it lets me express myself and communicate my ideas and interests to others in a unique manner that can be appreciated by others.
