## Oh, The Humanity!
Humans. The most diverse, complex life forms that exist on Earth.

But what is it that makes us so different?

The sheer complexity of life offers up many perspectives into what it is that makes us human.

Despite this, I believe there are three main categories which highlight key insights into the identities of humanity, those being:

1. **Biology**
    - The scientific characteristics that make us unique from other species, including both physical and mental traits.
2. **Culture**
    - The customs, traditions, creations and various other manifestations of humans, their intelligence, and their acheivements.
3. **Communication**
    - The many forms through which humans communicate thoughts, ideas, experiences, and knowledge to others.

These attributes, in my opinion, directly reflect the scientific complexity and expression of self that humans possess.
