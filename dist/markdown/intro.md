## Oh, The Humanity!
Humans. The most diverse, complex life forms that exist on Earth.

But what is it that makes us so different?

The sheer complexity of life offers up many perspectives into what it is that makes us human.

Despite this, I believe there are three main categories which highlight the building blocks of human identity, being:

1. **Biology**
    - The scientific characteristics that make us unique from other species, especially in regard to the physical traits of our bodies.
2. **Culture**
    - The traditions, ideas, creations and various other manifestations of human development and intelligence.
3. **Communication**
    - The many forms through which humans communicate thoughts, ideas, experiences, and knowledge to others.

These attributes, in my opinion, directly reflect the scientific complexity and expression of self that humans possess.

Please navigate through the website via the tabs above to further explore these categorical keystones of humanity.
